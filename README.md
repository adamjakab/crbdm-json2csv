JSON2CSV
==========

A brutal implementation of big(1GB+) json file conversion to csv without parsing.

It was only tested on data in this format:
```json
{"results":[{"statement_id":0,"series":[{"name":"occtest1","columns":["time","AP","clients"],"values":[
["2018-09-01T00:00:08.597587579Z","AH-0324c0",0],["2018-09-01T00:00:08.610509576Z","AH-04a580",0],
